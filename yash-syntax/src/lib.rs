//! Shell language syntax and parser
//!
//! This crate defines data types for constructing abstract syntax trees (AST)
//! of the shell language. See the [`syntax`] module for details.
//!
//! Some AST elements (e.g. [`Word`](syntax::Word)) provide a
//! [location](source::Location) where the element appears in the source code.
//! See the [`source`] module to learn how locations are coded in this crate.
//!
//! To parse source code into an AST, you can use the `parse` function on a
//! `&str`, which is enabled by the implementations of
//! [`FromStr`](std::str::FromStr) for the AST data types. However, ASTs
//! constructed this way do not contain very meaningful source information: All
//! locations' source will be [unknown](source::Source::Unknown). To include
//! substantial source information, you need to prepare a
//! [lexer](parser::lex::Lexer) with source information and then pass it to a
//! [parser](parser::Parser). See the [`parser`] module for details.
//!
//! The [`input`] module defines an abstract method for feeding the parser with
//! source code.
//!
//! This crate also defines the [`alias`] module that can be used to define
//! aliases that are recognized while parsing.
