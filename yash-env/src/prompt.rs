//! Types for injecting prompt string retrieval functions
//!
//! This module defines the type used for dependency injection:
//! a function that obtains the prompt string from the environment.
//!
//! The concrete implementation of that function is not provided by this crate;
//! it is implemented in another crate and stored inside [`Env::any`]. Callers
//! that need a prompt (for example the interactive input loop or the `read`
//! built-in) retrieve the injected function from `Env::any` and invoke it to
//! produce prompt strings.
//!
//! This file only supplies the type used for injection; registration and
//! concrete implementations are the responsibility of other crates that set
//! up the environment.

use crate::Env;
use crate::input::Context;
use std::pin::Pin;

/// Wrapper around the function that retrieves a prompt string
///
/// The wrapped function is expected to be injected into the environment (via
/// [`Env::any`]) by another crate and may be referenced by multiple consumers.
///
/// The function takes two arguments: the environment and the input context. It
/// returns a future that resolves to the final prompt string to be displayed.
/// Any errors encountered while generating the prompt string should be handled
/// within the function itself; the function should always resolve to a valid
/// string.
///
/// The most standard way to implement such a function is to use the
/// [`yash-prompt` crate](yash-prompt):
///
/// ```
/// # use yash_env::prompt::GetPrompt;
/// let mut env = yash_env::Env::new_virtual();
/// env.any.insert(Box::new(GetPrompt(|env, context| {
///     Box::pin(async move {
///         let prompt = yash_prompt::fetch_posix(&env.variables, &context);
///         yash_prompt::expand_posix(env, &prompt, false).await
///     })
/// })));
/// ```
