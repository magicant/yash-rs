//! This crate defines the shell execution environment.
//!
//! A shell execution environment, [`Env`], is a collection of data that may
//! affect or be affected by the execution of commands. The environment consists
//! of application-managed parts and system-managed parts. Application-managed
//! parts are implemented in pure Rust in this crate. Many application-managed
//! parts like [function]s and [variable]s can be manipulated independently of
//! interactions with the underlying system. System-managed parts, on the other
//! hand, depend on the underlying system. Attributes like the working directory
//! and umask are managed by the system to be accessed only by interaction with
//! the system interface.
//!
//! The [`System`] trait is the interface to the system-managed parts.
//! [`RealSystem`] provides an implementation for `System` that interacts with
//! the underlying system. [`VirtualSystem`] is a dummy for simulating the
//! system's behavior without affecting the actual system.
