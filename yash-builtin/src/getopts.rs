//! Getopts built-in
//!
//! The **`getopts`** built-in is used to parse options in shell scripts.
//!
//! # Synopsis
//!
//! ```sh
//! getopts option_spec variable_name [argumentâ€¦]
//! ```
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! The getopts built-in parses single-character options in the specified
//! arguments according to the specified option specification, and assigns the
//! parsed options to the specified variable. This built-in is meant to be used
//! in the condition of a `while` loop to iterate over the options in the
//! arguments. Every invocation of the built-in parses the next option in the
//! arguments. The built-in returns a non-zero exit status when there are no more
//! options to parse.
//!
//! The shell uses the `$OPTIND` variable to keep track of the current position
//! in the arguments. When the shell starts, the variable is initialized to `1`.
//! The built-in updates the variable to the index of the next argument to parse.
//! When all arguments are parsed, the built-in sets the variable to the index of
//! the first operand after the options, or to the number of arguments plus one
//! if there are no operands.
//!
//! When the built-in parses an option, it sets the specified variable to the
//! option name. If the option takes an argument, the built-in also sets the
//! `$OPTARG` variable to the argument.
//!
//! If the built-in encounters an option that is not listed in the option
//! specification, the specified variable is set to `?`. Additionally, if the
//! option specification starts with a colon (`:`), the built-in sets the
//! `$OPTARG` variable to the encountered option character. Otherwise, the
//! built-in unsets the `$OPTARG` variable and prints an error message to the
//! standard error describing the invalid option.
//!
//! If the built-in encounters an option that takes an argument but the argument
//! is missing, the error handling is similar to the case of an invalid option.
//! If the option specification starts with a colon, the built-in sets the
//! the specified variable to `:` (not `?`) and sets the `$OPTARG` variable to
//! the option character. Otherwise, the built-in sets the specified variable to
//! `?`, unsets the `$OPTARG` variable, and prints an error message to the
//! standard error describing the missing argument.
//!
//! In repeated invocations of the built-in, you must pass the same arguments to
//! the built-in. You must not modify the `$OPTIND` variable between
//! invocations, either. Otherwise, the built-in may not be able to parse the
//! options correctly.
//!
//! To start parsing a new set of options, you must reset the `$OPTIND` variable
//! to `1` before invoking the built-in.
//!
//! # Options
//!
//! None.
//!
//! # Operands
//!
//! The first operand is the option specification. It is a string that contains
//! the option characters the built-in parses. If a character is followed by a
//! colon (`:`), the option takes an argument. If the option specification
//! starts with a colon, the built-in does not print an error message when it
//! encounters an invalid option or an option that is missing an argument.
//!
//! The second operand is the name of the variable to which the built-in assigns
//! the parsed option. In case of an invalid option or an option that is missing
//! an argument, the built-in assigns `?` or `:` to the variable (see above).
//!
//! The remaining operands are the arguments to parse. If there are no operands,
//! the built-in parses the positional parameters.
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! The built-in may print an error message to the standard error when it
//! encounters an invalid option or an option that is missing an argument (see
//! the description above). However, this is not considered an error of the
//! built-in itself.
//!
//! It is an error if `$OPTIND`, `$OPTARG`, or the specified variable is
//! read-only.
//!
//! # Exit status
//!
//! The built-in returns an exit status of zero if it parses an option,
//! regardless of whether the option is valid or not. When there are no more
//! options to parse, the built-in returns a non-zero exit status.
//!
//! The exit status is non-zero on error.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! In the following example, the getopts built-in parses three kinds of options
//! (`-a`, `-b`, and `-c`), of which only `-b` takes an argument. In case of an
//! error, the built-in prints an error message to the standard error, so the
//! script just exits with a non-zero exit status when `$opt` is set to `?`.
//!
//! ```sh
//! a=false c=false
//! while getopts ab:c opt; do
//!     case "$opt" in
//!         a) a=true ;;
//!         b) b="$OPTARG" ;;
//!         c) c=true ;;
//!         '?') exit 1 ;;
//!     esac
//! done
//! shift "$((OPTIND - 1))"
//!
//! if "$a"; then printf 'The -a option was specified\n'; fi
//! if [ "${b+set}" ]; then printf 'The -b option was specified with argument %s\n' "$b"; fi
//! if "$c"; then printf 'The -c option was specified\n'; fi
//! printf 'The remaining operands are: %s\n' "$*"
//! ```
//!
//! If you prefer to print an error message yourself, put a colon at the
//! beginning of the option specification like this:
//!
//! ```sh
//! while getopts :ab:c opt; do
//!     case "$opt" in
//!         a) a=true ;;
//!         b) b="$OPTARG" ;;
//!         c) c=true ;;
//!         '?') printf 'Invalid option: -%s\n' "$OPTARG" >&2; exit 1 ;;
//!         :) printf 'Option -%s requires an argument\n' "$OPTARG" >&2; exit 1 ;;
//!     esac
//! done
//! ```
//!
//! # Portability
//!
//! The getopts built-in is specified by POSIX. Only ASCII alphanumeric
//! characters are allowed for option names, though this implementation allows
//! any characters but `:`.
//!
//! Although POSIX requires the built-in to support the Utility Syntax
//! Guidelines 3 to 10, some implementations do not support the `--` separator
//! placed before operands to the built-in itself, that is, between the built-in
//! name `getopts` and the first operand *option_spec*.
//!
//! The value of the `$OPTIND` variable is not portable until the built-in
//! finishes parsing all options. In this implementation, the value may
//! temporarily contain two integers separated by a colon. The first integer is
//! the index of the next argument to parse, and the second is the index of the
//! character in the argument to parse. Other implementations may use a
//! different scheme. Some sets `$OPTIND` to the index of the just-parsed
//! argument and uses a hidden variable to keep track of the character index.
//!
//! The behavior is unspecified if you modify the `$OPTIND` variable between
//! invocations of the built-in or to a value other than `1`.
//!
//! # Implementation notes
//!
//! The current implementation does not aggressively check that you pass the
//! same arguments to the built-in in repeated invocations or that you do not
//! modify the `$OPTIND` variable until the built-in finishes parsing all
//! options. The implementation may be changed in the future to check these
//! conditions.
