//! Umask built-in
//!
//! The **`umask`** built-in shows or sets the file mode creation mask.
//!
//! # Synopsis
//!
//! ```sh
//! umask [-S] [mode]
//! ```
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! The built-in shows the current file mode creation mask if no *mode* is
//! given. Otherwise, it sets the file mode creation mask to *mode*.
//!
//! # Options
//!
//! The **`-S`** (**`--symbolic`**) option causes the built-in to show the
//! current file mode creation mask in symbolic notation.
//!
//! # Operands
//!
//! *mode* is an octal integer or a symbolic notation that represents the file
//! mode creation mask. The octal number is the bitwise OR of the file mode bits
//! to be turned off when creating a file. The symbolic notation specifies the
//! file mode bits to be kept on when creating a file. The symbolic notation
//! consists of one or more clauses separated by commas. Each clause consists of
//! a (possibly empty) sequence of who symbols followed by one or more actions.
//! The who symbols are:
//!
//! - **`u`** for the user bits,
//! - **`g`** for the group bits,
//! - **`o`** for the other bits, and
//! - **`a`** for all bits.
//!
//! An action is an operator optionally followed by permission symbols. The
//! operators are:
//!
//! - **`+`** to add the permission,
//! - **`-`** to remove the permission, and
//! - **`=`** to set the permission.
//!
//! The permission symbols are:
//!
//! - one or more of:
//!     - **`r`** for the read permission,
//!     - **`w`** for the write permission,
//!     - **`x`** for the execute permission,
//!     - **`X`** for the execute permission if the execute permission is
//!       already set for any who, and
//!     - **`s`** for the set-user-ID-on-execution and set-group-ID-on-execution
//!       bits.
//! - **`u`** for the current user permission,
//! - **`g`** for the current group permission, and
//! - **`o`** for the current other permission.
//!
//! For example, the symbolic notation `u=rwx,go+r-w`
//!
//! - sets the user bits to read, write, and execute,
//! - adds the read permission to the group and the other bits, and
//! - removes the write permission from the group and the other bits.
//!
//! # Standard output
//!
//! If no *mode* is given, the built-in prints the current file mode creation
//! mask in octal notation followed by a newline to the standard output.
//! If the `-S` option is effective, the mask is formatted in symbolic notation
//! instead.
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! It is an error if the specified *mode* is not a valid file mode creation
//! mask.
//!
//! # Exit status
//!
//! Zero unless an error occurred.
//!
//! # Portability
//!
//! The `umask` built-in is defined in POSIX.
//!
//! POSIX does not specify the default output format used when the `-S` option is
//! not given. Our implementation, as well as many others, uses octal notation.
//!
//! This implementation ignores the `-S` option if *mode* is given. However,
//! bash prints the new mask in symbolic notation if the `-S` option and *mode*
//! are both given.
//!
//! An empty sequence of who symbols is equivalent to `a` in this implementation
//! as well as many others. However, this may not be strictly true to the POSIX
//! specification.
//!
//! The permission symbols other than `r`, `w`, and `x` are not widely supported.
//! This implementation currently ignores the `s` symbol.
