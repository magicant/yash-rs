//! Break built-in
//!
//! The **`break`** built-in terminates the execution of a loop.
//!
//! # Synopsis
//!
//! ```sh
//! break [n]
//! ```
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! `break n` quits the execution of the *n*th innermost `for`, `while`, or
//! `until` loop. The specified loop must lexically enclose the break command,
//! that is:
//!
//! - The loop is running in the same execution environment as the break
//!   command; and
//! - The break command appears inside the condition or body of the loop but not
//!   in the body of a function definition command appearing inside the loop.
//!
//! It is an error if there is no loop enclosing the break command.
//! If *n* is greater than the number of enclosing loops, the built-in exits the
//! outermost one.
//!
//! # Options
//!
//! None.
//!
//! (TODO: the `-i` option)
//!
//! # Operands
//!
//! Operand *n* specifies the nest level of the loop to exit.
//! If omitted, it defaults to 1.
//! It is an error if the value is not a positive decimal integer.
//!
//! # Exit status
//!
//! Zero if the built-in successfully breaks the loop; non-zero otherwise.
//!
//! # Portability
//!
//! The behavior is unspecified in POSIX when the break built-in is used without
//! an enclosing loop, in which case the current implementation returns an
//! error.
//!
//! POSIX allows the built-in to break a loop running in the current execution
//! environment that does not lexically enclose the break command. Our
//! implementation does not do that.
//!
//! # Implementation notes
//!
//! A successful invocation of the built-in returns a [`Result`] containing
//! `Break(Divert::Break(n-1))` as its `divert` field. The caller must pass the
//! value to enclosing loops so that the target loop can handle it.
//!
//! Part of the break built-in implementation is shared with the
//! continue built-in implementation.
