//! Break built-in
//!
//! This module implements the [`break` built-in], which terminates the execution of a loop.
//!
//! # Implementation notes
//!
//! A successful invocation of the built-in returns a [`Result`] containing
//! `Break(Divert::Break(n-1))` as its `divert` field. The caller must pass the
//! value to enclosing loops so that the target loop can handle it.
//!
//! Part of the break built-in implementation is shared with the
//! continue built-in implementation.
