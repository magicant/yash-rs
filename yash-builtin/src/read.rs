//! Read built-in
//!
//! The **`read`** built-in reads a line into variables.
//!
//! # Synopsis
//!
//! ```sh
//! read [-r] variableâ€¦
//! ```
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! The read built-in reads a line from the standard input and assigns it to the
//! variables named by the operands. Field splitting is performed on the line
//! read to produce as many fields as there are variables. If there are fewer
//! fields than variables, the remaining variables are set to empty strings. If
//! there are more fields than variables, the last variable receives all
//! remaining fields, including the field separators, but not trailing
//! whitespace separators.
//!
//! ## Escaping
//!
//! By default, backslashes in the input are treated as quoting characters that
//! prevent the following character from being interpreted as a field separator.
//! Backslash-newline pairs are treated as line continuations.
//!
//! The `-r` option disables this behavior.
//!
//! ## Prompting
//!
//! By default, the read built-in does not display a prompt before reading a
//! line. (TODO: Options to display a prompt)
//!
//! When reading lines after the first line, the read built-in displays the
//! value of the `PS2` variable as a prompt if the shell is interactive and the
//! input is from a terminal.
//!
//! Prompting requires the optional `yash-prompt` feature.
//!
//! # Options
//!
//! The **`-r`** option disables the interpretation of backslashes.
//!
//! # Operands
//!
//! One or more operands are required.
//! Each operand is the name of a variable to be assigned.
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! It is an error if the standard input is not readable.
//!
//! It is an error if any variable to be assigned is read-only.
//!
//! # Exit status
//!
//! The exit status is zero if a line was read successfully and non-zero
//! otherwise. If the built-in reaches the end of the input before finding a
//! newline, it returns non-zero, but the variables are still assigned with the
//! line read so far.
//!
//! # Portability
//!
//! The read built-in is defined in the POSIX standard. The `-r` option is the
//! only option defined in the POSIX standard.
//!
//! In this implementation, the value of the `PS2` variable is subject to
//! parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion. Other
//! implementations may not perform these expansions.
//!
//! # Implementation notes
//!
//! Reading from an unseekable input may be slow because the built-in reads the
//! input byte by byte to make sure it does not read past the end of the line.
