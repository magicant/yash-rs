//! Type built-in
//!
//! The **`type`** built-in identifies the type of commands.
//!
//! # Synopsis
//!
//! ```sh
//! type [nameâ€¦]
//! ```
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! The `type` built-in prints the description of the specified command names.
//!
//! # Options
//!
//! (TODO: Non-standard options are not supported yet.)
//!
//! # Operands
//!
//! The ***name*** operands specify the command names to identify.
//!
//! # Standard output
//!
//! The command descriptions are printed to the standard output.
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! It is an error if the *name* is not found.
//!
//! # Exit status
//!
//! The exit status is zero if all the *name*s are found, and non-zero
//! otherwise.
//!
//! # Portability
//!
//! POSIX requires that the *name* operand be specified, but many
//! implementations allow it to be omitted, in which case the built-in does
//! nothing.
//!
//! The format of the output is unspecified by POSIX. In this implementation,
//! the `type` built-in is equivalent to the [`command`] built-in with the `-V`
//! option.
//!
//! [`command`]: crate::command
