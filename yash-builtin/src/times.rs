//! Times built-in
//!
//! The **`times`** built-in is used to display the accumulated user and system
//! times for the shell and its children.
//!
//! # Synopsis
//!
//! ```sh
//! times
//! ```
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! The built-in prints the accumulated user and system times for the shell and
//! its children.
//!
//! # Options
//!
//! None.
//!
//! # Operands
//!
//! None.
//!
//! # Standard output
//!
//! Two lines are printed to the standard output, each in the following format:
//!
//! ```text
//! 1m2.345678s 3m4.567890s
//! ```
//!
//! The first field of each line is the user time, and the second field is the
//! system time.
//! The first line shows the times consumed by the shell itself, and the
//! second line shows the times consumed by its children.
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! It is an error if the times cannot be obtained or the standard output is not
//! writable.
//!
//! # Exit status
//!
//! Zero unless an error occurred.
//!
//! # Portability
//!
//! The `times` built-in is defined in POSIX.
//!
//! POSIX requires each field to be printed with six digits after the decimal
//! point, but many implementations print less. Note that the number of digits
//! does not necessarily indicate the precision of the times.
