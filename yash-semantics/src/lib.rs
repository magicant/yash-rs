//! Semantics of the shell language.
//!
//! This crate defines the standard semantics for the shell language. The core
//! of the semantics is command execution and word expansion.
//! A command can be executed by calling
//! [`Command::execute`](command::Command::execute).
//! A word can be expanded by using functions and traits defined in
//! [`expansion`].
//!
//! The [`read_eval_loop`] reads, parses, and executes commands from an input.
//! It is a utility for running a shell script.
