/// requires an asynchronous computation, `quick_expand` returns
/// `QuickExpand::Interim(_)` containing interim data. You continue the
/// expansion by passing the data to [`async_expand`](Self::async_expand), which
/// produces a future that will yield the final result. This two-step procedure
/// works around a limitation imposed by the current Rust compiler
/// (cf. [#68117](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/68117)).
