//! Handling traps.
//!
//! _Traps_ are an event-handling mechanism in the shell. The user can prepare a
//! trap by using the trap built-in so that the shell performs a desired action
//! in response to a specific condition that may occur later. This module
//! contains functions to detect the conditions and run trap actions
//! accordingly.
//!
//! # Related items
//!
//! Traps set by the user are stored in a [trap set](TrapSet) implemented in the
//! [`yash_env::trap`] module.
//! The `trap` built-in is implemented in the `yash_builtin` crate.
//!
//! # Signal traps
//!
//! When an [environment](Env) catches a signal with a function like
//! [`wait_for_signals`](Env::wait_for_signals) and
//! [`poll_signals`](Env::poll_signals), the signal is stored as "pending" in
//! the trap set in the environment. The [`run_traps_for_caught_signals`]
//! function consumes those pending signals and runs the corresponding commands
//! specified in the trap set. The function is called periodically as the shell
//! executes main commands; roughly before and after each command.
//!
//! # Non-signal traps
//!
//! The EXIT trap is executed when the shell exits normally, by running the exit
//! built-in or reaching the end of the script. The [`run_exit_trap`] function,
//! which should be called before exiting, runs the trap.

/// Helper function for running a trap action.
///
/// This function pushes a temporary frame `Frame::Trap(cond)` to the
/// environment stack and runs the trap action by parsing the `code` with the
/// given `origin`. The exit status of the trap action does not affect the exit
/// status of the current environment except when the trap action is interrupted
/// with `Result::Break(Divert::Interrupt(_))`. In that case, the exit status of
/// the trap action is left as is in the environment.
///
/// Other variants of `Result::Break(Divert::â€¦)` are simply passed on to the
/// caller. (It is unclear whether POSIX intends to require this behavior for
/// `Divert::Break` and `Divert::Continue`, but it is implemented this way for
/// simplicity. The exit status section of the POSIX return built-in
/// specification mentions the intended behavior for the `Divert::Return` case,
/// implying that the diversion should be passed on to the caller.)
