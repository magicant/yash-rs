/// Executes the simple command.
///
/// # Outline
///
/// The execution starts with the [expansion](crate::expansion) of the command
/// words. Next, the [command search](crate::command_search) is performed to
/// find an execution [target](crate::command_search::Target) named by the first
/// [field](Field) of the expansion results. The target type defines how the
/// target is executed. After the execution, the `ErrExit` option is applied
/// with [`Env::apply_errexit`].
///
/// # Target types and their semantics
///
/// ## Absent target
///
/// If no fields resulted from the expansion, there is no target.
///
/// If the simple command has redirections and assignments, they are performed
/// in a new subshell and the current shell environment, respectively.
///
/// If the redirections or assignments contain command substitutions, the [exit
/// status](ExitStatus) of the simple command is taken from that of the last
/// executed command substitution. Otherwise, the exit status will be zero.
///
/// ## Built-in
///
/// If the target is a built-in, the following steps are performed in the
/// current shell environment.
///
/// First, if there are redirections, they are performed.
///
/// Next, if there are assignments, a temporary context is created to contain
/// the assignment results. The context, as well as the assigned variables, are
/// discarded when the execution finishes. If the target is a regular built-in,
/// the variables are exported.
///
/// Lastly, the built-in is executed by calling its body with the remaining
/// fields passed as arguments.
///
/// ## Function
///
/// If the target is a function, redirections are performed in the same way as a
/// regular built-in. Then, assignments are performed in a
/// [volatile](Context::Volatile) variable context and exported. Next, a
/// [regular](Context::Regular) context is
/// [pushed](yash_env::variable::VariableSet::push_context) to allow local
/// variable assignment during the function execution. The remaining fields not
/// used in the command search become positional parameters in the new context.
/// After executing the function body, the contexts are
/// [popped](yash_env::variable::VariableSet::pop_context).
///
/// If the execution results in a [`Divert::Return`], it is consumed, and its
/// associated exit status, if any, is set as the exit status of the simple
/// command.
///
/// ## External utility
///
/// If the target is an external utility, a subshell is created.  Redirections
/// and assignments, if any, are performed in the subshell. The assigned
/// variables are exported. The subshell calls the
/// [`execve`](yash_env::System::execve) function to invoke the external utility
/// with all the fields passed as arguments.
///
/// If `execve` fails with an `ENOEXEC` error, it is re-called with the current
/// executable file so that the restarted shell executes the external utility as
/// a shell script.
///
/// ## Target not found
///
/// If the command search could not find a valid target, the execution proceeds
/// in the same manner as an external utility except that it does not call
/// `execve` and performs error handling as if it failed with `ENOENT`.
///
/// # Redirections
///
/// Redirections are performed in the order of appearance. The file descriptors
/// modified by the redirections are restored after the target has finished
/// except for external utilities executed in a subshell.
///
/// # Assignments
///
/// Assignments are performed in the order of appearance. For each assignment,
/// the value is expanded and assigned to the variable.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// ## Expansion errors
///
/// If there is an error during the expansion, the execution aborts with a
/// non-zero [exit status](ExitStatus) after printing an error message to the
/// standard error.
///
/// Expansion errors may also occur when expanding an assignment value or a
/// redirection operand.
///
/// ## Redirection errors
///
/// Any error happening in redirections causes the execution to abort with a
/// non-zero exit status after printing an error message to the standard error.
///
/// ## Assignment errors
///
/// If an assignment tries to overwrite a read-only variable, the execution
/// aborts with a non-zero exit status after printing an error message to the
/// standard error.
///
/// ## External utility invocation failure
///
/// If the external utility could not be called, the subshell exits after
/// printing an error message to the standard error.
///
/// # Portability
///
/// POSIX does not define the exit status when the `execve` system call fails
/// for a reason other than `ENOEXEC`. In this implementation, the exit status
/// is 127 for `ENOENT` and `ENOTDIR` and 126 for others.
///
/// POSIX leaves many aspects of the simple command execution unspecified. The
/// detail semantics may differ in other shell implementations.
