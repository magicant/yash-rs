# lineno-p.sh: test of the LINENO variable for any POSIX-compliant shell

posix="true"

# POSIX requires the $LINENO variable to be effective only in a script or
# function. However, the meaning of "script" is vague and existing shells
# disagree as to how line numbers are counted within functions. We only test
# common behavior of the shells in this file. More details are tested in
# lineno-y.tst as yash-specific behavior.
