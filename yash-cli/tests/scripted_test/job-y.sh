# job-y.sh: yash-specific test of job control

# This test case first creates a background job that immediately exits, then
# waits for the job to finish, sending a null signal to the job to poll if the
# job is still running. A subshell starts another job and waits for it to finish
# to make sure the main shell process receives the SIGCHLD signal and examines
# the latest job status. The test case checks if the job is reported as done
# before the prompt for the next line is displayed.
